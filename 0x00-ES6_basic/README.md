# ES6 Basics Task

This project contains a set of JavaScript tasks that focus on ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) features and best practices. It covers various ES6 concepts and syntax, including constants, variables, arrow functions, spread and rest operators, string templating, object creation, iterators, and more.

## Task Descriptions

The project consists of multiple tasks, Below are the tasks:

### 0. Constants and Variables

In this task, you'll practice using `const` and `let` to declare variables and understand the difference between them. The goal is to return specific values using `const` and `let`.

### 1. Block-Scoped Variables

modify variables inside a function to ensure they are not overwritten within a conditional block. The task is designed to test your understanding of variable scoping.

### 2. Arrow Functions and Default Parameters

rewrite a function using ES6 arrow functions and default function parameters to simplify the code.

### 3. Default Parameter Values

condense a function and use default parameter values to handle missing arguments.

### 4. Rest Parameters

The task requires you to modify a function to return the number of arguments passed to it using the rest parameter syntax.

### 5. Spread Operator

Using the spread syntax, you'll concatenate two arrays and each character of a string in a one-liner function.

### 6. String Interpolation

rewrite a function to use ES6 template literals to substitute variables within a string.

### 7. Object Properties

simplify the assignment of values to object properties by using the key name directly.

### 8. Computed Property Names

In this task, you'll modify an object to use ES6 computed property names for more concise property assignment.

### 9. Method Properties

The task requires you to rewrite a function to use ES6 method properties for method definitions within an object.

### 10. For...Of Loop

rewrite a function to use the ES6 `for...of` loop and avoid using the `var` keyword for variable declaration.

### 11. Creating Objects

create an object that maps a department name to a list of employees using ES6 features.

### 12. More Object Manipulation

This task involves creating an iterator object to go through every employee in every department in an object.

###101. Iterating Through Object

create a function that iterates through an iterator object and returns employee names separated by '|'.
